## What is Cloud Computing?
- Cloud Computing is the delivery of on demand services over the inernet on a pay as you basis.

#### Why cloud Computing? What are the benefits of cloud computing?

- Cloud is incredibly important for businesses because it provides flexibility, data recovery, virtually no maintenance, and easy access to its users. Furthermore, its high level of security provides ease of mind as you can rest assured knowing your data is right where it needs to be and only accessible by authorized individuals.

**Benefits Of Cloud Computing**:

**Cost:**
This technology reduces company costs because you aren’t responsible for purchasing hardware and software that needs to be set up and run on-site. All of the major mechanical aspects of cloud computing are managed off-site by a third party.

**Speed:**
Since cloud computing is a service provided on demand, large amounts of resources and data can be provided instantly. This means that with just a few moments, you can access almost any file you have saved in your cloud, making the speed of access far greater than alternate methods of data storage.

**Productivity:**
Cloud computing also helps improve productivity since it doesn’t require the same amount of hardware setup that other data centers need. Other IT management responsibilities that could take a lot of time are also not needed for the cloud, allowing your team to focus on business-related matters and keeping them focused on the task at hand.

**Reliability :**
With cloud, you receive more reliability since it allows you to easily backup data, set contingencies for data recovery, and streamlines business continuity. 

**Security :**
One of the biggest benefits of cloud technology is its increased security. Most cloud providers offer policies, technologies, and other options that help to increase your company’s data security. This provides greater defense against threats to your data and infrastructure.
